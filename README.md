# Project 3 - *Yelp-Clone*

**Yelp-Clone** is a Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](https://www.yelp.com/developers?country=US).

This app was a lab for [CodePath](https://codepath.org/).

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] Table rows for search results should be dynamic height according to the content height. (3pt)
- [X] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints. (+5pt)
- [X] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does). (+2pt)




Please list two or more ways you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

- 1 Search results page
   - 1.1 Infinite scroll for restaurant results. 
   - 1.2 Implement map view of restaurant results.
